## NA02. Survive the Rebellion ##

### Prelude ###

From NA01, The party had just taken a huge leap of faith off of the
high tower of the dungeon into a seemingly empty frozen lake. They
survived, having been slowed by some device from the (obviously
invisible then) boat of the Rebellion. However, after the party landed
safely at the bottom of their slowed fall, they were each knocked out
by the unseen Rebels... As they are not the elf they expected to jump.

#### Meta Info ####

This is an adventure module for a Heavily Modified version of 3.5
edition Dungeons and Dragons. It is intended for 4-5 5th Level
Characters, and was specifically written as part of an ongoing
campaign entitled, "End of the Empire."

This Adventure Module is free to read, use, distribute, and modify. It
is licensed (as much as it can be) under the [CC-BY-SA 3.0][cc]
license. Anything that must be licensed under the [OGL][ogl],
is... but I personally do not like what that license requires of
authors, and therefore would prefer a different license.

#### Introduction ####

<div class="small box"> <p>"You are awakened with an ice cold
waterfall poured over Your heads. Unfortunately, You cannot see
anything, find Your arms and legs roughly tied to wooded chairs, and
once the water finishes draining from around Your heads, You can feel
the warmth of Your breath bouncing back into Your faces... Some kind
of bag or cloth is around Your faces."</p>

<p>" 'Now that we are all awake and well rested, perhaps You can help
me out.' The voice which speaks seems to be calm, cool, collected, and
a little been contentious towards You... Though at least, it is not
openly hostile. 'See, my men and I are a bit confused. We were
supposed to have Young Xian jump from the tower onto our little
vessel, but instead of that most promising Young Elf, We find Four
Bungling Criminals and their pet Goblin. Don't worry, he is resting
quite safely... for now. We'll see how long that lasts, depending on
how You all behave.'</p>

<p>" 'Anyway, let me get to the point. Who are You, and Where is
Xian?' At this, he falls silent, seemingly awaiting a response, of
some sort. What do You do?"</p>

</div>

The party is being questioned in hoods, tied to chairs. They must now
negotiate their survival with their Captors. This entire encounter is
based on the following conditions:

The Rebels are worried about Xian. They also are worried about these
Strangers. There are, therefore, two conditions to be met: Trust in
the Party (paramount) and Emotional Health (paramount).

__Condition Points__ are a simple system for determining the outcome
of a conflict which  does not include combat. Simply put, if an
attempt goes well, they gain a condition point or two. If it goes
poorly, they lose one or two. Each listing has a target: Once the
target is met, _if the party decides to stop with their tomfoolery at
that point,_ then that target path is played out. If it is below the
target (or conditions for ultimate failure are met) then the target
path is not played out, instead, a failure path is played out for that
condition.


__Trust in the Party__: -10 CP. (Target: 0 or higher.)

Things which may help:

- Treating Xian with respect.

- Showing they were wrongly imprisoned.

- Contempt for the government.

- Distrust of the Rebels, but openmindedness.

Things which may hurt:

- Failed Bluffs.

- Exact Opposite of the above.

- Refusal to talk.

__Emotional Health__: 6 CP. (Target: 0 or higher.)

This is a HP-like Condition: it has no success, only failure. The
following things hurt:

- Disrespecting Xian.

- Being rebellious or stupid.

- Trying to escape.


_NOTE: This is meant to be a fairly easy challenge, as it is only the
second module. Be fair, perhaps overly so, with the point allowances._

#### Failure ####

If the party fails to convince the rebels of their safety, Jareth is
cut loose in the waters and left to drown (as he is an Creature of
Air, this fails terribly). The rest of the party are then knocked out,
robbed, and left for dead on the shores of Dort'ar. The Rebellion is
now also their enemy.

They are directed to the next adventure by an ad in the town,
considering they are now hurt and looking for a friend of any kind,
since they are weak and alone in this world.


#### Success ####

The Bags are removed from their heads, and Jareth is brought into the
room. They are then untied, and then told the following:

<div class="small box"> <p>" 'Well, I suppose we trust You- At least as
far as we could throw You, for now. But before we take You anywhere
near our base of operations, we will definitely need to see how far we
can throw You.' At this, each of You are picked up by three masked
men, and are taken above deck, to be thrown overboard."</p>

<p>" 'Did You know that this lake never freezes? See, even though it
is *WELL* below freezing down there right now, there is so much salt
in the lake that it just doesn't coalesce. It really is a miracle of
nature, when You think about it...' He laughs. Then he motions for the
men to stop. 'Now, provided that You don't want to experience this
wonder first hand, we do have a job that needs doing. See, Xian was
supposed to do it, and he's now indisposed, due to unforseen
circumstances. Are You interested?' "</p>

If they refuse, they are thrown overboard, and (if they survive) are
pushed over to the failure condition above. If they accept:

<p>"'Alright, good. See, there is a high ranking member of the
Resistance who got herself caught by the empire. She's been imprisoned
in a huge dungeon on an island out here. She's been in there for 6
months, and must be near death by now. I want You to find her, and
bring her back to the resistance, so she may help us again.' "</p>
</div>

They sail for another 3 hours, and eventually an island is in
sight. They are given weapons, armor, and provisions by the
Resistance, and then a rowboat to make it to shore. Should they
attempt to row away, they are killed with fire. The resistance then
sails away, saying they will return in a week. 



### Adventure ###

#### Room A: The Entrance ####
There is a huge fortification with a large painting of the symbol of the empire
across the doors. They open out, and require at least two people to
move at all.

Upon entering the dungeon, read the following:

<div class="small box"> <p>"Upon entering the dungeon, You are greeted
with a very odd sight: there seems to be no one here. There are 17
empty cells, in two rows: one along the far wall, with 9 cells, and
one split by the doors, with 8. Looking in the cells, there is no one
there: Each cell door is open, and there are no lights in the entire
room. What do You do?"</p>
</div>

This room is a bluff. There are three secret doors: each leading
passed the far wall's row. Roll 1d20 to find which of the cells they
are investigating, and the outcome thereof.

|--------------------------------------------------------|
|Roll (1d20)| Result (what happens)                      |

| 18        | Dynamite: Hear sound, then explosion, (2d6)|
| 19        | Reroll                                     |
| 20        | Reroll                                     |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------|


#### Room B: The Lying Guards ####

<div class="small box"> <p>"Crawling through the door, You come to a
large room with two unmoving statue-like skeletons. There is a sign
above them, saying the following: 'There is certain death for those
who choose the wrong path here. One of these guards always tells the
truth, the other always lies. They will only respond to one question,
which must be asked while touching the helmet of the guard in
question. Good luck.'"</p>
</div>

The correct question is, "Which door would the other guard say is the
right one?" If they ask that question (or some similar variation
thereof) then they are pointed to __Room C__, which is the wrong door,
and should be ignored. If they fail to ask the correct question, they
head down the path to __Room C__ regardless. If they ask the right
question but still go down the wrong path, they head to __Room C__. 
Otherwise, they head to __Room G__.

#### Room C: Arrow Trap ####
Have them all roll spot checks. DC 17. If any succeed, tell them this:

<div class="small box"> <p>"As You head passed the door, You notice
that there are very square tiles on the floor of this room. Each has a
different symbol on them. There are also small stones in the wall,
with glyphs around them.... And Slits in the wall, with small points
of metal at the bottom. What do You do?"</p>
</div>

Hand them the chart which is the pictoral representation of the
floor. They must find the right way across, using the Zoso Symbols as
a guide.


#### Room D: Conjoured Guardsmen #1 ####

<div class="small box"> <p>"You open the door at the far end of the
room. Roll Spot Checks. (DC 17)"</p>

<p>Those Who Succeed: "For a split second, You notice the chamber to
be empty. However, with a small flash of light and a puff of smoke,
You find some assailants suddenly appearing in the middle of the
room."</p>

<p>Else: "The room, You can see, is fairly large. There are not too
many torches on the walls, but the ones that are there are lit and
bright. On the far wall, You see a door with some writing on it. The
center of the room, however, harbors what appear to be guardians in
the midst of some billowing smoke."</p>

<p>"Three cloud-like masses are at the front, with the surrounding
smoke wafting up and through what appears to be a swirling vortex of a
body. They seem angry, and move towards You."</p>


<p>"Aside them, stand two small goblins: Who look a bit like you
(point to Air Goblin Character). They are armed with bows and dressed
in Shirts made of small chain links, and are bookending the room, one
on each side."</p>

<p>"What do You do?"</p> </div>

__Number in Encounter: 3 Elementals, 2 Goblins.__

##### Fluff and Details #####

This is the result of an unfindable magical trap placed on the
entrance to the room. Simply put, the trap was _inside_ the next room,
and therefore unfindable. The spells cast were: Summon Monster
VI. Should they have somehow located and negated that trap, the
goblins are still here, and the Elementals are not. As they were
summoned by a spell, dismissal will work on them. As will running out
the clock, since they only last here for 12 rounds.

#### Post Combat Oppurtunities ####

If the party captures a goblin, it will eventually reveal the
following. Anything not listed, it does not know.

- "We just work for Lelana. We don't know anything."

- "We Guard the Red Gem. Keep it away from Thean."

- "We been here for 7 months. Holding down the fort."

- "Please don't kill me. I want to live."

If a non-evil member of the party kills the goblin, take
note. Alignment change has now begun. Otherwise, they may do with him
as they please.

If at any time, the party heads to the left side of the room, be sure
to have them roll spot checks. The secret door is there. 

##### The Door #####
<div class="small box"><p>"As You approach the door, the text rapidly
becomes more visible. It reads, 'I am not a rebel. Go Away.' The knob
is glowing bright blue. What do You do?"</p></div>

- __Detect Magic__: Strong Evocation Magic on the handle.

- __Find Traps / Search as Rogue__: DC 23, Shocking Grasp. 5d6
  electricity damage.
  
  The door, once dealt with in one way or another, leads to __Room
  F__.
  

#### Room E ####
<div class="small box"><p>"You crawl in through the hole in the wall,
and come to a room bathed in a pale red light. In the center of the
room, on a non-descript pedestal, is a red gem. It seems to be the
source of light in this room. What do You do?"</p>
</div>

This is the red gem the goblins were guarding, and the first of two
meant to open the door at the front of the dungeon. There are no traps
here, but play it up at every juncture, as if there were. Double
Bluff.

#### Room F ####
<div class="small box"><p>"You open the door, and see a large, black
obelisk in the center of the room. On the top, You see a small red
gem. However, as You look at the floor, You notice a 30 foot drop, all
around the room. There are spikes at the bottom of this pit, and only
a single rope tied around the obelisk and hitched to a bolt in the
wall, to Your right. What do You do?"</p></div>


__Tight Rope__ Balance DC 20, Catch Yourself Dex 15. 


The spikes are there, but if You fall You never reach them. They are
beneath a perfectly clear magical wall, and when a character falls, he
stops just above them.

This Gem is _NOT_ the one for the lock, though the PCs cannot know
that. The real gem is in __Room F__.
