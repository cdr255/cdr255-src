## End of the Empire ##

This page is devoted to collecting the various modules, articles,
errata, and play history of a major dnd 3.5e-Mod campaign I am
running, which started with on the 13th of June, 2013 CE. It deals
with the land of Theovaone, a fictional world I have created, and
especially with the Empire of Bae Dhru'lan, a large country/colonial
complex in the mid-North of the Mainland.

The party consists of a motley sort, many of whom are yet unaware of
the great role they will play in the history of the realm. In the
interest of keeping things relatively in character, I will refrain
from naming names at this point, but the class/race makeup is as
follows:

- A Dark Air Goblin Rogue

- A Half Air Elven, Half Human Ranger

- A Tiefling Cleric

- An Aassimar Sorcerer

- A Werebat

Each has been convicted of a crime against the state in the Trade City
Dort'ar, and sentenced to the dungeons near the docks. The Ranger,
Cleric, Sorcerer, and Werepony have been thrown in one cell, with the
Rogue having been stored... someplace else. Winter, though waning, is
still in full force, and the dungeons are cold and dark and moist with
death. The waves of the Frozen Bay are beating hard against the outer
walls; there is a momentous drama in the air. To stay would mean their
almost certain death. To escape would mean becoming fugitives from the
law... if they even get that far.

What will they do?

#### Lineup Change the First, 2013/09/15 ####

After the siege of the Rat Cellar, The Tiefling Cleric, Sharazad,
disappeared in the night (Went off to school). As this is a game, it
_just so happens_ that the very next morning, a new party member
arrived. Who is this person? How will they react to the party? And
What of Jareth, who was missing for a part of that night, as well?
Stay tuned.
