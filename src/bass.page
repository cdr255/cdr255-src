My journey on the bass has been one fraught with indecision and
strife, most of which was completely unnecessary. I took _quite_ a
long time to figure out that the electric guitar was something which
annoyed me to play, and continuously avoided the idea of the bass on
the grounds that it was "too simple." I was completely wrong.

I know this now, and absolutely adore playing bass. I have an Ibanez
Gio Soundgear Bass (a red one), tuned to DGCF (That gives me a better
range for the pieces I generally play, with a sacrifice of only a few
never used notes.) which I used to play fairly often. I loved every
moment of it, and find that what I once considered to be a limited
number of strings to allow creativity I just cannot achieve when
playing on a six string electric. In a word, the Electric bass was
"right" for me.

In the past few months, I kinda got away from playing bass. I was
frustrated with the difficulties of finding people to play with (it is
so much _harder_ to do than it is with my harp...) and other aspects
of my life were in desperate need of my attention. So, in an effort to
make myself start playing again (and to keep myself a bit more honest
about how much and how often I practice on the bass) I have decided to
put my entire repertoire up on this site.
