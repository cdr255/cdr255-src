## Misc ##

There are certain things I do which are either too few in number or
too obscure in purpose to be given their own true section just
yet. These will live here, as soon as there are any. This page is
mostly here in moral support of the other pages right now. Well, at
least the moral support of the Tech and Writing Pages, that is. Music
Doesn't really need any help, and games is off hanging out in front of
the whole pack. Oh well. At least it's trying it's best to be a good
page. Maybe one day it will cease being a waste of time and space. It
Loves You all the same, though.

### Projects ###

- [Vinescript][vine] - A Writing System I am developing, for use in
    my very own conlang.

- [End of the Empire][eote] - A dnd campaign I started in Summer 2013,
    set in Theovaone.

- [Din'lunahedi][din] - My First Fully-In-Depth Pathfinder Character,
  a Gnome Alchemist who goes by 'Din'.

- **Character Detail Sheet** [doc][detaildoc] [odt][detailodt] - A
   simple 2 page document to help flesh out and define characters used
   in ttrpgs.
