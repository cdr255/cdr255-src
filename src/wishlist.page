I am in the midst of a computer build; any of the following will help
to mitigate some of the costs of putting together a strong-enough
gaming / audio production pc:

**RAM** (38.99): [link](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/gskill-memory-f310666cl7d4gbxh)

**Case** (59.98): [link](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/rosewill-case-challengeru3)

**Power Supply** (55.59): [link](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/silverstone-power-supply-st60fes)

Other than these (as I realize these are expensive (and let's face it,
components are not the most fun things to recieve or to give on
holidays)), I have a few specific items for other aspects of my life
that I am interested in:

**Raspberry Pi Starter Kit** (61.95): [link](http://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-Complete-Original-Preloaded/dp/B008XVAVAW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1385573425&sr=8-2&keywords=raspberry+pi)

**Bluetooth Folding Keyboard** (34.99): [link](http://www.amazon.com/Perixx-PERIBOARD-805L-Bluetooth-Folding-Keyboard/dp/B00BU4OV50/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1385659455&sr=8-1&keywords=magnetic+folding+bluetooth+keyboard)

**USB-MIDI Controller Keyboard** (49.00): [link](http://www.amazon.com/Akai-Professional-LPK25-Ultra-Portable-Controller/dp/B002M8GBDI/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1385659855&sr=8-4&keywords=midi+controller)


Let me know if these will work out.
