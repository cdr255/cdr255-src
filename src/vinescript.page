I love conlangs.

Conlangs are Constructed Languages, the most famouse examples of which being 
Klingon and Tengwar. They are languages that, instead of growing naturally out
of a similar group of people needing a way to communicate, were delibrately
made to exist because one single or group of people wanted the language to
exist.

My first step on creating my own conlang is a script system I am developing called
__Vinescript__. It is currently in version 0.1a, and can be used to write fully
functional, unchanged American English. At the moment, I have mostly used it to
write peoples names.

This page will document the progress I have made on it, as well as providing all
of the resources needed in order for those interested to learn and use vinescript.
There __will__ eventually be a codex, a workbook, and a font up here, as well as
a good gallery of images. For now, I'll simply introduce the script with my name 
written in it, and provide a small roadmap for future development.

### Roadmap ###

- Finalize current character shapes, add languuage specifier tohead.

- Add Characters for the full ASCII charset.

- Develop First Version of the Font.

- Create First Version of the Codex.

- Write First Version of a Workbook.

- Add Characters for modified latin alphabets (Spanish, French, German)
