## Arrangements ##

__Learning to play a tune should be easy.__

This page houses all of the arrangements I have done up for others or
myself, in order to allow them to learn a specific piece. Many of
these are in the public domain, as by far the largest section of these
is and will be Early Music (as in, Pre-Baroque) which is unfortunately
fairly hard to find in modern notation.

Others of these are not in the public domain. These are my own
arrangements of various music from Video Games, often Video Games no
longer in print. I enjoy a LARGE amount of these pieces, and do not
want them to die with their commercial copies, so I have arranged them
here. (NOTE: These will __NOT__ be transcriptions. I will be adding or
changing something in each piece, as I feel uncomfortable just
verbatim writing down a copyrighted piece of work.

If You enjoy these, or have a request, please do not hesitate to
[email me] about it! I am always looking for new pieces to play!
