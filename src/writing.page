## Writing ##

There are times that I, or those I know, are moved to put pen to paper
or finger to key and write.  These come few and far between, to be
sure, but they are there... and that means that I need somewhere to
present them to You, our loyal audience.

Here, for Your viewing pleasure, live the writings we have tried so
hard to create. I hope You enjoy them as much as we did.
