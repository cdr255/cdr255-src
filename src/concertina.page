I Love Traditional Music.

Irish, Scottish, Welsh, English, Spanish... I play a lot of these
tunes on my harp. It is great fun, and one of the main reasons I began
to learn to play music in the first place. There is only one problem
with playing these tunes on the Harp: The harp is so big and unwieldly 
for things like seisiuns and busses.

This led me to seek out a second instrument, one which was capable of
playing most or all of the tunes in the above repertoires. I
originally considered the bag pipes, but was quickly informed by my
friends and relatives that that was not a real, livable solution (some
people have no taste, I guess). Then, I heard Grainne Hambly play the
concertina on the album, "Traditional Music from Ireland and
Scotland." It clicked, and that Christmas, I was lucky enough to
recieve my very first button box.

I am very pleased with my current one: a Rochelle Anglo from
Concertina Connection. I had taken leave of most of my music for a
bit, after my Grandmother passed away, but I am now back at it and
raring to play. This chart is meant to keep me honest and practicing,
and to organize the tunes I have played all in one place so I don't 
"forget which ones I know" as I so often do. Enjoy!
