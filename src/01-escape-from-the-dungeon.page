## NA01. Escape from the Dungeon ##

### Prelude ###

I Ran this adventure module with the idea of 

#### Meta Info ####

This is an adventure module for a Heavily Modified version of 3.5
edition Dungeons and Dragons. It is intended for 4-5 3rd Level
Characters, and was specifically written as part of an ongoing
campaign entitled, "End of the Empire."

This Adventure Module is free to read, use, distribute, and modify. It
is licensed (as much as it can be) under the [CC-BY-SA 3.0][cc]
license. Anything that must be licensed under the [OGL][ogl],
is... but I personally do not like what that license requires of
authors, and therefore would prefer a different license.

#### Introduction ####

<div class="small box">
<p>"As You open Your eyes, You are greeted with the visage of a cold,
moist stone cieling. From the Slitted windows in the wall comes the
sound of the Frozen Bay, along with the occasional sea spray as the
waves crash against the outside walls. You see four others slowly
rousing themselves on the dirty, blood stained floor, and are then
greeted with the memory of what has happened to You. As the true
weight of Your situation begins to sink in, You are greeted with words
in a voice cut with equal parts contempt and amusement. "</p>

<p>" 'Oh, We're Finally Up, are We?' The man who spoke is fully armed,
and has one hand gripping the metal bars which make the front wall of
Your newfound cage. His breath is clearly visible as he speaks, made
smoke in the cold winter air. "Well, it is about time. I was beginning
to worry I'd have to come in and wake You up meself."  With this, he
lets out a cruel chuckle, and steps back from the bars. He takes a
seat in a wooden chair just to the right of Your cell, leans back, and
says, 'Well, this here's Your new home. That there's Your
family. Might as well get used to it. Just keep it down, it's about
time I got some rest meself. There'll be plenty of time for us to get
to know each other later.'  "</p>

<p>"With this, he falls silent. There is a small dripping in the
distance, in counterpoint to the steadily violent waves outside. This
is soon joined by his snoring, which is both loud and long. He seems a
fairly heavy sleeper. What do You do?"</p>

</div>

The members of the party have all been arrested and convicted of
various "Crimes against the State," and sentenced to the
dungeons. Through serendipity, they all have been placed in the same
large cell. In the Empire of Bae Dhru'lan, convicted criminals are put
to Sleep, and processed while they are unconscious. This is the state
which the party is in at the start of this adventure. 

Whoever has the highest fortitude save is the one who wakes up first.
The rest, in order, wake up each round following.


### Adventure ###

#### Room A: The Cell ####
The Players must first figure out how to get out of their prison cell.

_This is a __Roleplay Challenge__. It is basically up to the players to
decide what to do, but in the interest of making things run smoothly
there are a few pre made checks below. The General DC for an unlisted
but plausible attempt to succeed is 12._

#### Roleplay Challenge #1: Escape the Cell ####
__General DC: 17__
_If the Player does not try to keep the guard from finding out, upon a
successful roll, the guard wakes up. If the Guard can spot what the
players did, then he runs to get help, in the form of three other
guards and a guard hound (Bad Combat Scene Below).


- _Pickpocket the guard:_ If a player decides to be ballsy and attempt
  to steal from the guard, he must first describe how he does so. The
  DCs for various approaches are:
   
   1. Just Reach In: DC 22.
   2. Tip His Chair Over: DC 25.
   3. Use a Stick to Reach In: DC 18.
   4. Some Kind of Magic: DC 15.

  _Success:_ The Player now has a key to the cell. He still must use
  it to unlock the cell without causing attention.
  
  _Failure:_ The Player Awakens the Guard, and Angers him. The Guard
  Hangs the key on the wall, on the other side of the hall from the
  cell, out of reach.

- _Break The Bars:_ If a player decides to try and force their way out
  of the cell, he must first describe exactly what he is doing in
  order to allow him to leave. Various Ideas and DCs:
  
  1. Bend the Bars: DC 20.
  2. Break The Bars from the Wall: DC 20.
  3. Break the Lock: DC 17.
  4. Pick the Lock: DC 22.
  
  _Success:_ The Player Succeeds in modifying the bars in some
  way. Guards will notice, especially the one that is waking up.
  
  _Failure:_ The Guard Wakes up and beats the player who attempted to
  escape in this way. 1d4 damage with a blackjack.

__Number in Encounter:__ 2-4 Guardsmen (3 standard).

##### Fluff and Details ######
Upon Successfully escaping the dungeon, the party alerts the
guards. This is usually because of the watchguard noticing the Players
being up to no good. He fires off a wand down the hall, and moves to
attack as the other two guards run to his help, arriving on each side
after the first round.

If the player incapacitated the watch guard in some way, then the
guardsmen are patroling the hallways, as per standard Bae Dhr'ulan
Prison Protocol. There are then only 2 in this encounter, not 3.

Across the hall (DC 13 Spot Check) is a hidden door, underneath a hook
(the key hook from above). Inside are the +1 Weapons listed on the
character sheets of the players. The Hidden door is made of stone.

The Guardsmen understand that Defeat (or even Escape, for You)
probably equals their own deaths. They will not be bribed,
intimidated, convinced, or any kind of talk-effected out of this
encounter. They must be incapacitated, or killed, to effectively end
this conflict.

#### Room B: Cell Hallway ####

<div class="small box">

<p>"Having Won Your Temporary Freedom, You take a look around. The
floor is littered with the bodies of Your now former jailers. There is
a single torch lighting the wall, next to a hook upon which rests a
small ring of keys. There are exits to the East and the West, with
loud, painful noises seeming to come from the West. The East, on the
other hand, is deathly silent. Both are far too dark for human eyes to
see down. What do You Do?"</p>

</div>

Characters who have dark vision are greeted with a curving hallway to
the east, and a corner with a door to the west. Players with normal
sight will find these out should they cautiously search (or simply
dive in.

If the players do not hide the bodies in some way, the guards will
find them on their next patrol and come looking for the escaped
prisoners. If they put the bodies in the cell, especially if they are
stripped, then the guardsmen simply assume that those are the new
prisoners... until the party makes it up to the second floor, that is.

If the Party Goes West, Read __Room C__.

If the Party Goes East, Read __Room E__.

#### Room C: Torture Room ####

<div class="small box">

<p>"You head down the hallway, toward the loud and piercing
screams. The hallway makes a sharp turn to the north, and on the
facing wall there is a slightly ajar door. The Screams appear to be
coming from behind it."</p>

</div>

#### If they Continue Down the Hallway: ####

<div class="small box">

<p>"Passing by the door, You come to a large metal grate, with a guard
sitting on the other side. This guard is different, however: Pale
orange skin, with fangs jutting up from his lower lip, his yellow eyes
are both attentive and menacing. At Your approach, he darts to his feet,
says something in a language none of You understand, and runs off down
the hallway."</p>

</div>

This grate is locked, and needs a key to open. There is a key on the
second key ring, which is found in __Room E__. The players may try to
get around the grate in any way they wish, as before, but all will
fail. This is a well made grate, which separates the lower level
security from the upper level.


#### If they open the Door: ####

<div class="small box">

<p>"As You push open the door, the visage of a tied up, badly wounded,
naked Elf is the first thing to catch Your eye. The cause of his
wounds is readily apparent: Directly in front of him, in a huge metal
harness, is the form of a rat... Only 10 times larger. It is soaked in
some kind of slimy, green, foul smelling liquid, and slashing at the
elf's chest as it hisses menacingly. The elf screams once again as
huge chunks of his flesh are torn from his body."</p>

<p>Holding a whip in one hand, and the leash of the harness in the
other, is a guardsman with cornflower hair. He is completely covered
in specks of dried blood, and seems to be enraging his charge as best
he can. As the door opened, however, his attention moves from the
helpless Elf and to You, and he yanks the rat over to attack.</p>

__Number in Encounter:__ 1 Guardsmen Trainer & 1 Venomous Rat.


##### Fluff and Details #####
The Guardsman Trainer has to keep one hand, his dominant, on the leash
attached to the Venomous Rat. His Whip attack is in his off hand, -2
to hit. If he drops the leash, the rat has a 25% chance (1 on a 1d4)
of turning on him. Otherwise, it continues its attacks until the next
round, making this check each time. The Prisoner Elf is Extremely
Wounded, but Still Alive (unless killed during combat.)

#### Post Combat Oppurtunities ####

If the Players Keep the Elf Being Tortured Alive, they have 10 Rounds
to Question Him before he succumbs to death. He knows the following
useful information:

- "There is a boat outside, that is part of the Dort'ar City
  Resistance."
  
- "I was to escape today, saved by making a deal with the
  Resistance."
  
- "I could have been free, had I just made it up to the top of the
  watchtower."
  
- "The Resistance are the only way out of here."

- "They will be beneath the window of the tower for the next half
  hour. Then they will depart."
  
If the Elf dies before the Information Above is Revealed, then the
only clue the party gets is the one on the letter on the floor of the
room, should they find it by searching the room.

If they Search the Guard, they find all of his items, along with the
partially translated note.

The Note is Supposed to read thusly:

"We will be beneath the watchtower at Midnight tonight. One Hour
Only. Jump."

It was translated into a crytogram. The Cypher should change with
every game, so it is not included here.

#### Room D: The Low Level Barracks ####

<div class="small box">
<p>"The Hallway snakes around a few times before opening up into a
large room. There are a few bunk beds, in various states of order, as
well as a selection of lockers on the far walls."</p>
</div>

Have the Players Roll Move Silently, DC 15.

#### Success: ####

<div class="small box">
<p>"There are a few guards snoring in various beds, but they do not
awaken on Your approach. There is a huge door in the north marked with
the word "Captain." Other than that, there is the hallway You came
from. What do You do?</p>
</div>

If they wake the guards for any reason, go to "Failure."

The Lockers contain studded leather armor x4, longsword x4, and
cure moderate wounds potionx4 (standard guards locker).

The Captains door is locked, but the key is on the keyring that was in
front of their cell, if they took it. If they try to open the door,
the captain hears and readies himself. If they simply have the key,
then the captain is surprised and cannot act in the first round of
Room E's Conflict.

If the Party tries to do anything to the captains door, there is a
ghost sound trap that goes off, unless they checked for traps and
disarmed/dispelled it. It is "A Loud Roaring Voice Calling 'Intruders!
Seize them!'" and wakes up the guards, unless they have already been
dealt with. The Key obviously negates this trap.

#### Failure: ####

<div class="small box">
<p>"As You walk into the room, You hear startled snores. They continue
for a few second and then cease, with their owners darting out of
their beds, holding small daggers, but wearing little else. They move
towards You, muttering about putting You back in Your cell."</p>

#### Room F: Behind the Grate ####

<div class="small box">
<p>Opening the Grate, You discover that the Path leads one of two
staircases: It branches off to the North and to the South. You must hurry to
the tower, as it is now about quarter to one. Both look equally dark
and ominous, and both have light shining from around their
corners. From the one in the north, You can hear talking in some kind
of language (goblin). From the South, You hear only crashing
waves. The Choice is Yours.</p>
</div>
No Matter which Route they Choose, the other one will contain __Room J__
at the top. The one they choose, therefore, will have __Room I__.

The South Path Leads to __Room G__. The North, to __Room H_.


#### Room G: The Room Of the Cages ####

<div class="small box"> <p>From the Staircase, You can see that this
room is filled with various size cages, all stacked Haphazardly upon
one another. Inside, there are a bunch of sleeping humanoid creatures
of various color: Red, Green, White, Blue. Upon Closer inspection,
each of these creatures has a brand: Upon the arm of a white colored
Goblin lying defeated in the cage, there is a large "A" Branding. In
the Center of the Room, is a large Glowing Green Gem. There is a
staircase leading up, in the North end of the Building.</p>

</div>

Questioning these creatures leads to no intellegent response: They are
defeated and resigned to their fates.

Moving the Glowing Green Gem Summons Four Lesser Elementals: Fire,
Water, Wind, and Earth.

#### Room I: Plague Chests ####

<div class="small box">
<p>The Top of this tower... has no windows. Instead, there are large
chests guarded by two statues. A Huge Sign says, "Do Not Touch!"</p>

</div>
These Chests contain, from left to right, the Three Plague Spirits:
Pride, Greed, and Sloth. Letting them out allows me to use them in
future adventures.

#### Room H: The Goblin Warrior Ambush ####

<div class="small box">
<p>Upon reaching the top of the stairs, You are greeted with four
small, green, befanged warriors, who ambush You from around the hole

#### Room I: The Jump ####

<div class="small box">
<p>"Having reached the top of the tower, You see a large window. The
Window overlooks the frozen bay, which lies in wait around 100 ft
below. There is no ship visible beneath You."</p>
</div>

When They Jump, Read this:

<div class="small box">
<p>"You fall, the drop lasting just long enough to realize that You
have made a great mistake... when all of a sudden, You slow to a crawl
and land safely on the thin air. Seeing nothing, You briefly wonder
what is going on before You feel a sharp pain on the back of Your
head, and everything goes dark."</p>

<p>"You have successfully escaped from the prison. Congratulations."</p>
</div>
