## Music ##

By far the largest Section on this site, the Music Section is split
into four main groups.

The First Group Deals with [Lessons][lessons]. I teach both 5 String Banjo and
Acoustic Guitar professionally, and host a good amount of the
materials I have created to do so on this site, so that both my
students and others may easily get ahold of them and learn to
play. These are provided free of charge, in the spirit that they be
shared freely as well. You may distribute them under the
[CC-BY-SA 3.0][cc] license.

The Second Group contains all of my own [Compositions][comp]. These include
Classical-Style Compositions, Chipmusic Tracks, and Other odds and
ends that don't fit anywhere else. Though I do accept donations, these
are provided once again free of charge (with the sheet music, if I
have drawn it up) and may be distributed under [CC-BY-SA 3.0][cc], so
feel free to pass these pieces around. If You make a derivative of one
of my compositions, I only ask to be given the chance to hear it!

The Third Group is my (written out) [Arrangements][arrange] of other
composer's works. These include two main categories: Public
Domain/Early Music, and Video Game Music (mostly older, from out of
print games. These are not simple transcriptions, but my own
arrangements: I did not simply copy someone else's work. That said,
these arrangements are now hereby licensed (as much as an arrangement
can be) under [CC-BY-SA 3.0][cc], so feel free to distribute, change,
and learn them as much as You would like to. All I ask, is that I have
a chance at some point to hear it! 

Finally, there is a Group of [Recordings][record] on this site. These
are mostly live recordings of Christopher Rodriguez playing something,
usually the harp. Some of these may be hosted elsewhere, though I
always keep local backups, so they will never be lost to the
ether. These recordings, as well, are hosted under the
[CC-BY-SA 3.0][cc] license, and can be traded around and shared
freely.
